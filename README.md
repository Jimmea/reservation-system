# Example Reservation System
This application is a demonstration of a generic hotel reservation system that demonstrates the use of:
* ReactJS (and react-based packages)
* Webpack
* Apollo (Client and Server)
* GraphQL
* Express
* Node.js
* Docker
* Docker-Compose

## Installation
To run this application, simply clone the code to a destination of your choosing and run the following command:
`docker-compose up`

*Make sure to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed first*

## TODOs
While this is a full-functioning sample, there are things that I would like to enhance/complete given enough time, including:

### Client-side
* Edit and Delete functionality
* Date formatting on the forms
* Sorting on various data points
* Modal use on Creating/Updating forms for better UI/UX
* A login system of some kind

### Server-side
* Consolidating functionality into controllers (to be shared between GraphQL and REST endpoints)
* Edit and Delete functionality
* More and better searching/filtering
* Caching server-side of calls using a keystore of some kind
